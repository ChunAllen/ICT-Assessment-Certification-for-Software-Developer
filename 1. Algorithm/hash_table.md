# Hash Table

is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value


The Hash table data structure stores elements in key-value pairs where

- **Key** - unique integer that is used for indexing the values
- **Value** - data that are associated with keys.

In a hash table, a new index is processed using the keys. And, the element corresponding to that key is stored in the index. This process is called hashing.

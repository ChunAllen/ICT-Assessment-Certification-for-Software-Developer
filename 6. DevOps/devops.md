# DevOps

- is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes



#### How DevOps works
- development and operations teams are no longer â€œsiloed
- Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function



#### Benefits of DevOps
- Speed
- Rapid Delivery
- Reliability
- Scale
- Improved Collaboration
- Security

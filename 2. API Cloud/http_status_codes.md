# HTTP Status Codes

An HTTP status code is a three-digit number a server generates in response to a browser’s request. Like 404, for example, which you’ve likely seen before.

#### HTTP Status Codes Explained
There are five different HTTP status code categories (or classes). Each one represents a different response from the server to the browser.

- **1XX** — Informational codes: The server acknowledges and is processing the request.

- **2XX** — Success codes: The server successfully received, understood, and processed the request.

- **3XX** — Redirection codes: The server received the request, but there’s a redirect to somewhere else (or, in rare cases, some additional action other than a redirect must be completed). 

- **4XX** — Client error codes: The server couldn’t find (or reach) the page or website. This is an error on the site’s side. 

- **5XX** — Server error codes: The client made a valid request, but the server failed to complete the request.

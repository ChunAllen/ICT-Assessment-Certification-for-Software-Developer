# Software Testing Lifecycle

The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a systematic approach to testing a software application to ensure that it meets the requirements and is free of defects. It is a process that follows a series of steps or phases, and each phase has specific objectives and deliverables. The STLC is used to ensure that the software is of high quality, reliable, and meets the needs of the end-users.

The main goal of the STLC is to identify and document any defects or issues in the software application as early as possible in the development process. This allows for issues to be addressed and resolved before the software is released to the public.

The stages of the STLC include Test Planning, Test Analysis, Test Design, Test Environment Setup, Test Execution, Test Closure, and Defect Retesting. Each of these stages includes specific activities and deliverables that help to ensure that the software is thoroughly tested and meets the requirements of the end users.

Overall, the STLC is an important process that helps to ensure the quality of software applications and provides a systematic approach to testing. It allows organizations to release high-quality software that meets the needs of their customers, ultimately leading to customer satisfaction and business success.



#### Phases of STLC
- **Requirement Analysis** - in this phase quality assurance team understands the requirements like what is to be tested. 
- **Test Planning** - is in this phase manager of the testing, team calculates the estimated effort and cost for the testing work.
                - includes identifying the testing objectives and scope
                - Developing a strategy, selecting the testing methods and techniques that will be used.
                - Identifying the testing environment and resources needed
                - Identifying the test cases that will be executed and the test data that will be used
                - Estimating the time and cost required for testing
                - Identifying the test deliverables and milestones
                - Assigning roles and responsibilities to the testing team
                - Reviewing and approving the test plan
- **Test Case Development** - this phase testing team notes down the detailed test cases. The testing team also prepares the required test data for the testing. When the test cases are prepared then they are reviewed by the quality assurance team
- **Test Environment Setup** -  Basically, the test environment decides the conditions on which software is tested. This is independent activity and can be started along with test case development. In this process, the testing team is not involved. either the developer or the customer creates the testing environment
- **Test Execution** -  In this phase testing team starts executing test cases based on prepared test cases in the earlier step. The activities that tkae place during the test execution stage of Software Testing Lifecycle (STLC)
  - Test Execution, Defect Logging, Test Environment Setup, Test Execution, Defect Retestingm Test Reporting
- **Test Closure** - Test closure is the final stage of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) where all testing-related activities are completed and documented. The main objective of the test closure stage is to ensure that all testing-related activities have been completed and that the software is ready for release.

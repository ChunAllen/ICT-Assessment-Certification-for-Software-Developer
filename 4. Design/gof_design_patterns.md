# Gang of Four, Design Patterns

- Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides 
- These 4 authors published a book titled Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software 1994
- According to these authors, design patterns are primarily based on the following principles of object oriented design 

#### Usage of Design Patterns 

- **Commmon platform for developers** - design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario. For Example a singleton design pattern signifies the use of single object so all developers familiar with single design pattern will make use of single object and they can tell each other that program is following a singleton pattern
- **Best Practices** 


#### Types of Design Patterns
From the book there are 23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories
- **Creational** - provides a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives more flexibility to the program in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.  
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder  
  - Factory Method
  - Prototype
  - Singleton
    
- **Structural** - These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance, is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities. Object of one class will be used to another class
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy
  
- **Behavioral Patterns** - These design patterns are specifically concerned with **communication** between objects
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Interpreter
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template method
  - Visitor
